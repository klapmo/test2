      <h2>My Hobbies</h2>

      <p>I'm a big movie guy</p>
      <p>I'll just put this out there, I'm a big movie guy. Love watching them, talking about them, reading about them. You name it, I'll partake. So much so, that I've even kept a running 
        Google Sheet of each movie I watch per year (for the first time), with a grade scale and what genre it's in. Over the years I've layered in more data, so now I can go back and run 
        reporting on movies I've seen and my taste over the years. I realized that this added layer would be considered nerdy by some, but for me it's a time capsule of what my year was like 
        or how I was feeling. It's something fun to share, as well, with friends looking for recommendations. I am trying to do this with all the media I consume, including books, TV, and video games.<br>
        <br>I also love video games. Growing up, my dad and I would play Zelda until one of us had to fall asleep. Spoiler alert: I didn't sleep much as a kid. Now I'm 30 and things really haven't changed, 
        except for the sleeping thing. I still love the puzzle oriented games, but have developed a taste for FPS and these newfangled Battle Royale games (Apex Legends > Fortnite don't @ me). This is less enjoyable for my wife 
        but she's a good sport about it.<br>
        <br>Finally, I'm trying to read 2 books a month as part of my 2019 intentions, which hasn't been going great. I love Stephen King books, and really all fiction, but I'm challenging myself to read 
        a self-help/business book each month as well. I think this is what's derailing me. I love sci-fi, horror, and fantasy - Harry Potter and IT being my favorite books ever. I tend to pick an author and read 
        as much as I can of their work. <cite>Haroun and the Sea of Stories</cite>, by Salman Rushdie, is one of those must-read, never heard of books that I will recommend to the unfortunate reader of my page.

      <div class="realimg"></div>
      <img src="brain.jpeg" alt="Brain">
      <p>While I'm a pretty process-oriented person, I do like to stretch my creative wings once in a while. I love to draw, or really doodle if I'm being specific, 
        and wish I did more of it. I like doing puzzles, too, which I think lends itself nicely to coding. I like to understand what the desired final product is and then working 
        backwards to make that happen.<br>
        <br>Music is an outlet for me as well, letting me get lost in it while I work on things. I'm a huge Grateful Dead fan, which is what I'm likely listening to if you see me wearing my headphones 
        and in the zone. My friends and I started a vinyl club, where each month we are randomly assigned someone else and buy a record for them. There are not requirements as to the genre, no requests accepted, 
        and it makes for a cool project. I've since grown my collection considerably with music I'd have otherwise never considered or heard. For me, this is where my creative mind awakens. I love a challenge 
        but need to have the right setting to tackle it with my full effort.

      <img src="../David.jpg" alt="David Headshot" width=100%>
      <p>It's hard to summarize myself in a short blurb, but I am a tech lover, video game aficianado, and eater of all foods.
        Recently married, I've been with my wife for nearly 10 years, though just shy of 1 year married. I am a dog fan (boo cats!)
        and cannot wait to have one of my own.

      <p>While I tend to not be very active on social media, I'm still worth the follow.
        See what I'm up to by following <strong>@klapmo</strong> on basically all platforms. I'm pretty great at branding
        and have the same user across (nearly) every platform.</p>
