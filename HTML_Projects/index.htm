      <p>Let me bring you up to speed...</p>
      <p>So, recently I left my role as a Manager of the Customer Success team at ActiveCampaign. 
        Initially I was brought on to lead a standard CSM team, responsible for churn, upsells, and retention.
        Upon arriving, I found that I would be responsible for developing the onboarding plan for our entire org,
        not only for managed accounts, but unmanaged, and everyone in between. This task was far outside my wheelhouse
        and ultimately was a bad fit for me. I didn't have a developed point-of-view, which got in the way of me performing
        at the level I am used to.

      <p>As I get ready for class to start...</p>
      <p>In the lead up to our 10-week Python course, I have been spending a lot of time getting to know the neighborhood
        that I've lived in for 5+ years! I make sure that I try somewhere new for lunch every day, since the options are endless
        it's easy to loop back to your favorite place to avoid the decision making process. I've begun keeping a list of all the lunch
        specials in the area so I can be smart about increasing variety. My hope is to build a webapp for myself to help in that process. 
        Trust me, putting that on your wife is the fastest way to either a bad time, or no dinner.
        Speaking of which, I recently got married! Below are a few choice shots from our amazing honeymoon. Take a look!

      <img src="David.jpg" alt="David Headshot" width=100%>
      <p>It's hard to summarize myself in a short blurb, but I am a tech lover, video game aficianado, and eater of all foods.
        Recently married, I've been with my wife for nearly 10 years, though just shy of 1 year married. I am a dog fan (boo cats!)
        and cannot wait to have one of my own.

      <h3>Follow Me</h3>
      <p>While I tend to not be very active on social media, I'm still worth the follow.
        See what I'm up to by following <strong>@klapmo</strong> on basically all platforms. I'm pretty great at branding
        and have the same user across (nearly) every platform.
